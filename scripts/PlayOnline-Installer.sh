# container and of every module, and Square Enix's own loader. playonline.route
# rewrites the staged tree so that it boots through this package's loader
# (scripts/assets/playonline/polbbnexec.kelf, source in
# scripts/helper/playonline/loader-src). The Viewer's boot ELF and IOP image
# go into the loader. The modules become plain files where the build has
# Square Enix's plaintext switch (every Viewer from the 1.13 era on), and are
# keyed to the drive where it does not (the two 2003-era discs). It needs:
#
#   an HDD ID          minted once and kept. The loader serves it to the
#                      console, and keyed modules are built against it
#   a boot executable  taken from one of the user's discs; Square Enix's
#                      public keys, which open a disc's containers, are read
#                      out of it
#   the loader         shipped with the toolkit
#

# cannot do the conversion says so in the plan and installs the disc form.
