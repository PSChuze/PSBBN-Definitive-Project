"""Where a file out of a disc container is allowed to land.

Square Enix's containers do not all hold plain relative paths. FFXI's MISC
records use `../../` deliberately: those entries leave `image/ffxi/` so that
`res/` lands at the root of the partition, where `config.sys` and `info.sys`
belong. Refusing `..` would drop them, and joining them unchecked could
write outside the output directory. The rule is therefore containment:
resolve the path against the output root and require the result to stay
under it.
