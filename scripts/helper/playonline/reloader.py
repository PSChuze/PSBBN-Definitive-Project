"""Bring the loader on an installed Viewer partition up to date, in place.

The Viewer boots through `dnasload.elf`, which is this package's loader with
the Viewer's gated boot executable inside it. A later version of the package
can change either the loader or a gate table. The installer leaves an
existing partition alone, so without this module such a fix would reach only
drives installed afterwards.

Only that one file is replaced. The new loader is written over the file's
existing extent: no allocation and no directory change, only the file's
bytes and its inode's size and checksum. Nothing is written if the file
already matches.

    python3 -m playonline.reloader DRIVE --partition PP.SCUS-97269.1000.POLVIEWER \
