"""The titles this installer knows, their partitions and sizes.

Partition names follow `PP.<product>.<slot>.<TAG>`. The slot and the tag are
Square Enix's choices and follow no rule (Tetra Master is 0002, Janhourou
0003, Dirge 0010, FFXI 0001), so the names and `se_mib` values here are those
Square Enix's installer uses. The installer refuses a title that is not in
this table.

`status`, which the installer prints:

    tested        the title starts on a console
    installs      the partition builds and verifies
    unsupported   the name and size are known; this package cannot build it

A partition is a power of two of at least 128 MiB, the APA granule. `MAX_MIB`
is 8192, the largest main partition this installer creates. Square Enix
never exceed 1024 MiB in one header (a large title is a 1024 MiB main plus
sub-partitions). `se_mib` and `subs_mib` record Square Enix's sizes; `needs_subs`
records that they split the title and gates nothing.
