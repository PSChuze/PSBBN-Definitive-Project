r"""Make a staged tree bootable: the container, and the record that keys it.

A tree staged from a disc holds the boot container and every `.pex.enc`
module in the universal form, the one discs and the patch server carry. A
universal container includes its own bulk key (the RSA block at
`file[512:640]`, keystore slot 15), so it can be read without any drive
material. A drive boots either the installed form, re-encrypted under a key
bound to one HDD ID, or decompressed plaintext modules. This module converts
the staged tree before the partition is written, so nothing on the drive is
edited in place.

`prepare` fills the package's own loader (loader.py) with the Viewer's boot
ELF and IOP reboot image and writes it as `dnasload.elf`. Modules become
plaintext where the Viewer build has Square Enix's plaintext switch and are
transcrypted otherwise. With `--se-dnasload` Square Enix's loader is kept and
patched instead, which needs the user's console keys.

Transcrypting has two outputs, and they must agree:

  the installed container   replaces the staged one
  the `__net` record        written at `__net` + 0x201800, outside any
                            filesystem, holding the value the container's
                            key was derived with

Every `.pex.enc` is converted along with the boot container, because the
Viewer loads them all through the same path. The HDD ID used here must be the
block the console is later served (see hddid.py): a mismatch is not detected
at conversion time, and the modules then decrypt to noise.

The key derivation reads Square Enix's constants out of a disc boot
executable, passed as `--derive-elf`. `polkey` has a `BUILDS` table for
`SLPS_202.00` and `SLUS_217.04` and detects which one it was given. The
constants are identical in both builds; only their addresses differ.

#
# Everything above converts the tree for Square Enix's boot chain, in which
# their `dnasload` opens the installed container. That chain has no room for
# the HDD ID shim a generic drive needs, and opening `dnasload` takes the
# user's console keys. The default route therefore boots the package's own
# loader (loader.py, loader-src/): the Viewer's boot ELF and IOP reboot image
# go into the signed loader, which reboots the IOP, installs the shim and
# enters the ELF. It is written as `dnasload.elf`, so the browser entry does
# not change.
#
# Because the boot ELF is patched here, the partition can hold plaintext
# modules, which is the mode this project targets: modules are not keyed per
# drive, so one translation or update serves every drive. The switch is
# Square Enix's own (polplaintext.py) and is present in every build from the
# 1.13 era on. The two 2003-era discs lack it; their modules are transcrypted
# and still boot through this loader.
