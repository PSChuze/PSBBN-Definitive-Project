"""Read back the sector the console writes while it boots, and say what it says.

Once the Viewer has been entered it owns the screen, and a console that stops
needs a power cycle, which clears IOP RAM. The disk is the only medium that
survives, so a diagnostic loader records its progress in one 512-byte sector.
`loader-src/poltrace.h` defines the record and the rules that keep the write
safe; this is the other end of it.

The sector is the first one of `/trace.bin` in the Viewer partition. The
installer writes that file, blank but for its magic, and reads it back on
every later run. The magic is the safety catch: the loader reads the sector
before its first write and refuses unless the magic is already there, so a
wrong location costs one harmless read and nothing else.

Nothing here needs the console to have written anything. A blank record reads
as "the console has not reached the trace yet", which is itself the answer
when a title returns to the browser having drawn nothing.
