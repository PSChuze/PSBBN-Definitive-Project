/* polbbnexec: the loader written to the PlayOnline Viewer partition as
 * dnasload.elf, in place of Square Enix's.
 *
 * It does the retail dnasload's job without any of the crypto: reboot the IOP
 * from the Viewer's own image, install the HDD ID shim, copy the plaintext
 * boot ELF into place and enter it with ExecPS2.
 *
 * The IOP reboot is required. HDD-OSD's pfs offers two mount units and the
 * Viewer uses three (pfs0 for the Japanese IME partition, pfs1 for the title
 * partition, pfs2 for its own), and HDD-OSD's resident hdd and pfs would
 * collide with the newer pair the Viewer loads for itself. It has to be
 * SifIopRebootBuffer with the Viewer's IOPRP image; a plain SifIopReset does
 * not bring the drive up.
 *
 * Nothing is mounted here. The Viewer's boot ELF mounts its own partition on
 * pfs2:. argv[0] has the `hdd0:<partition>:pfs:/<file>` shape the retail
 * dnasload builds for its child.
 *
 * DRIVERS selects what stays resident under the Viewer (see main). ps2sdk's
 * ps2dev9 (exports dev9 1.09) and ps2atad (exports atad 1.03) can sit under
 * Sony's hdd (imports dev9 1.02, atad 1.01) because loadcore only needs an
 * equal major version and an imported minor no greater than the exported one.
 *
 * Linked at 0x01800000 so that copying the Viewer's segments (0x00100000,
 * 0x001d8000, 0x00800000) cannot overwrite this code.
 *
 * The FORK_ prefix on the macros and the POLBBNFORKHDR1 magic are historical
 * names. The installer finds the header by that magic, so they are kept.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The install header.
 *
 * The loader is signed once and shipped. It does not link in one
 * title's boot ELF, which differs per region and per Viewer version. It
 * reserves slots that the installer fills with plain byte patches:
 *
 *   - the boot ELF, into the elf slot, with its length in the header
 *   - the IOP reboot image, into the ioprp slot, likewise
 *   - the HDD ID the shim serves, which has to be the block the partition's
 *     modules were transcrypted against
 *
 * That is possible because a KELF built by polkelf --encrypt carries its
 * content in one unsigned, unencrypted block: only the first 32 bytes are
 * signed and encrypted, and the header, bit table and root signatures cover
 * neither the content nor its length. An install therefore needs no
 * toolchain and no console keys.
 *
 * The installer finds the header by its magic, so a rebuild that moves it
 * does not break the installer.
