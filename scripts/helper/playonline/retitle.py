"""Show the Japan-only titles under English names on an English install.

Janhourou, Dirge of Cerberus and Front Mission Online were released only in
Japan, and the US Viewer launches all three. Their names are shown from two
places, neither of which the game itself reads:

    the browser entry   `icon.sys` in the partition's attribute area:
                        `title0`, `title1` and the three `uninstallmes`
                        lines. Shown by HDD-OSD and the Sony browser.
    `/res/info.sys`     `title`, `genre` and `note`. Shown by PSBBN's game
                        list.

On a drive installed for the US Viewer both are rewritten in place on
whichever of those partitions exist. A Japanese install is left unchanged.

The browser entry keeps its exact size. The English text is shorter than the
UTF-8 Japanese, and the difference is made up with trailing spaces on the
last line changed (Square Enix's own entries carry trailing spaces too), so
no slot or offset moves. `info.sys` is rewritten inside the zones it already
has, with the inode's size and checksum updated, through a reader that
follows sub-partitions because `/res` can sit in any of them.

`info.sys` is also a row in each title's `file.txt`. Its hash there is left
alone: nothing checks it at launch, and changing the manifest would make the
patch client see a difference from the server's copy.
