"""Check that the files the PlayOnline installer adds hold nothing of Sony's or Square Enix's.

Everything proprietary the installer needs comes from the user at run time:
their discs, their console's BIOS, their MagicGate keys. None of it may be
committed. The checks:

  every added file is text          a stray .ico, .pex or disc dump is binary
  no Sony or Square Enix markers    strings that begin their data files and
                                    should not begin a source file
  no key material                   long hex or base64 runs that could be a
                                    key, a digest table or a dumped block

By default it runs over the files the installer adds to the toolkit:

    python3 -m playonline.shipcheck            # the whole added tree
    python3 -m playonline.shipcheck PATH ...

# The signed loader, built from loader-src. It is checked instead of being
# exempted: its install header must be present, at the current version and

# the other markers. The ELF marker and the HDD ID magic are expected in it:
# the loader is an executable, and its shim searches its own image for that
# magic to find the slot it serves. The default block behind the magic in the
# shim is generated, and the install header's block stays empty until an install
