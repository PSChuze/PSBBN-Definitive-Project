"""Show how far pfsshell has got through a command list.

pfsshell prints its `> ` prompt once for every command it takes off stdin
and nothing else that is regular. This module reads pfsshell's output on
stdin, counts the prompts against the number of commands the caller says
were sent, and redraws one progress line on the terminal. A large title is
tens of thousands of files and would otherwise install in silence.

    sudo pfsshell < cmds 2>&1 | python3 -m playonline.pfsprogress 41234 --log FILE

The output is not passed through, because it is about a megabyte of prompts
for a big title. With `--log FILE`, only the pieces that look like an error
are appended there. The count is a guide only; `build --verify` is the
check.
